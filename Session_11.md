* Round 2 (continued)
	* One of the enlarged Duergar rushed to Midnight and tried to strike her, but missed.
	* A different Duergar rushed at her. Ragnar managed to hit him, but the Duergar still stabbed her hard enough to knock her out.
	* Ragnar tried to hit a Duergar twice...but missed.
* Round 3
	* The fire expands some and RJ takes damage.
	* He takes a brief trip around one of the Duergar and hits him with the spiritual warhammer.
	* Sheelah also missed.
	* Gryn was unable to constrict his target.
	* A Duergar stabbed RJ for a whole lot of pain. At the same time, RJ's shield electrified the Duergar while the fire burned his ass.
	* Another Duergar attacked Ragnar, but missed.
	* Same with the third.
	* The fourth Duergar became visible and struck Gryn.
	* Ragnar struck one of Duergar with his _booming blade_ and fears no fire.
* Round 4
	* The fire expands, killing two of the Duergar and injuring Ragnar.
	* RJ cast _spare the dying_ on Midnight and the spiritual hammer managers to do some damage.
	* Sheelah ended the life of one of the Duergar, leaving only Gryn's.
	* Gryn managed to _really_ fail at constricting the Duergar.
	* The Duergar struck Gryn again, forcing him back into his normal self.
	* Ragnar "leapt" over the fire and missed the Duergar that was attacking Gryn.
	* The fire expanded, threateningly.
* Round 5
	* RJ healed Midnight some and then GTFO
	* Sheelah ran around the fire and hit the Duergar with an arrow.
	* Gryn cast _heat metal_ on the Duergar. Owwww.
	* Midnight popped _through_ the fire and missed the Duergar with _eldritch blast_
	* The Duergar disengaged and got the hell out.
	* Ragnar chased after the Duergar and totally fucking missed.
* Round 6
	* MORE FIRE
	* RJ ran so fast.
	* Sheelah GTFO
	* Gryn missed with _guiding bolt_ but heated the hell out of the Duergar.
* And well, the rest of the party was left inside of the burning inn. RJ got out through a small hole.
* The party managed to get out through a window with some of the Duergar suuplies.
* A number of townsfolk showed up to help put the fire out. Midnight explained the situation that led to the fire. The townsfolk are not exactly thrilled with the situation and think the group should leave.
* The group took a short rest and RJ healed everyone some more before they returned to the castle.
* While waiting to talk to the cult's leader, the group talked to their soothsayer ("Granny").
	* Granny talked about how she has been dreading this moment.
	* Granny said that the party will be the one to stop the Duergar warlord from destroying Icewind Dale.
		* The warlord has a forge with the still-beating heart of a red dragon
		* He's also using the shardalin
		* It's in the Spine of the World
		* He's taking advantage of the Auril situation but he's not a part of it
		* We're not strong enough to fight him and need to gain _experience_
	* And then she died
	* And then Cadroth ran in and things got awkward
	* And then Avarice walked in and commented on Midnight
	* She has an _opportunity_ for the group
		* She needs some protectors while out in the icy wastes
		* It's dangerous
		* It's well compensated
		* That's all the group gets to know until they accept
		* It's some kind of "Spire", an old ruin
	* Avarice took her leave while Midnight tried to make friends with the cat.

* Round 2 (continued)
	* One of the enlarged Duergar rushed to Midnight and tried to strike her, but missed.
	* A different Duergar rushed at her. Ragnar managed to hit him, but the Duergar still stabbed her hard enough to knock her out.
	* Ragnar tried to hit a Duergar twice...but missed.
* Round 3
	* The fire expands some and RJ takes damage.
	* He takes a brief trip around one of the Duergar and hits him with the spiritual warhammer.
	* Sheelah also missed.
	* Gryn was unable to constrict his target.
	* A Duergar stabbed RJ for a whole lot of pain. At the same time, RJ's shield electrified the Duergar while the fire burned his ass.

# Session 23
* Basically, Easthaven is kinda fucked because of the chardalyn infecting them with demonic mania.
* Oh boy. We're going to the Ice Maiden's island. But we'll probably got some sweet loot out of it.
* Vellynne Harpell has a Plan.
* Lots of backstory on Vellynne and why she's mad.
* Oh no, we're down one bear but Vellynne has us covered.
* There's a FAST way to get to the island. With Angejuc
* We take sled dogs way out there. Out by the sea of the moving ice. There's a big pole. With a cross and a bell.
	* "You've got to ring the bell."

# Session 23
* Basically, Easthaven is kinda fucked because of the chardalyn infecting them with demonic mania.
* Oh boy. We're going to the Ice Maiden's island. But we'll probably got some sweet loot out of it.
* Vellynne Harpell has a Plan.
* Lots of backstory on Vellynne and why she's mad.
* Oh no, we're down one bear but Vellynne has us covered.

# Session 23
* Basically, Easthaven is kinda fucked because of the chardalyn infecting them with demonic mania.
* Oh boy. We're going to the Ice Maiden's island. But we'll probably got some sweet loot out of it.
* Vellynne Harpell has a Plan.
* Lots of backstory on Vellynne and why she's mad.
* Oh no, we're down one bear but Vellynne has us covered.
* There's a FAST way to get to the island. With Angejuc
* We take sled dogs way out there. Out by the sea of the moving ice. There's a big pole. With a cross and a bell.
	* "You've got to ring the bell."
* Sheelah rang the bell. With an arrow.
* Vultures came running
* ROUND 1
	* Vultures circled.
	* RJ blessed us.
	* Ragnar tried to feed the vultures.
	* Sheelah cast *speak with animals* and learned a little bit too late that "men with arrows" were gonna be here.
* ROUND 2
	* Negotiations went poorly.
	* RJ decided to Shatter a bunch of people who lined up in a very convenient manner.
		* "My god, he's using magic!"
	* Vultures are suddenly showing a lot of interest in the men with arrows.
	* Ragnar fucking people up left and right.
	* Sheelah's bow reminded them that they picked a bad day to go hunting.
	* Vellynne is all "fucking whale"
	* Vulture made a poor life decision wrt Ragnar.
	* RJ doing stuff.
	* Ragnar being merciful to the hunters but not the stupid vulture.
	* Hunters be like "BOOM GOES THE DYNAMITE" :boom:
	* And there's a big hole in the ice now.
	* And Sheelah goes under.
	*

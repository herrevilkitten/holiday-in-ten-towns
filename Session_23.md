* Vellynne Harpell has a Plan.
* Lots of backstory on Vellynne and why she's mad.
* Oh no, we're down one bear but Vellynne has us covered.
* There's a FAST way to get to the island. With Angejuc
* We take sled dogs way out there. Out by the sea of the moving ice. There's a big pole. With a cross and a bell.
	* "You've got to ring the bell."
* Sheelah rang the bell. With an arrow.
* Vultures came running
* ROUND 1

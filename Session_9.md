## Session
* In the Ice Cave...
	* Round 1
		* One of the ice wolves told the party they look delicious. The other chastised him.
		* Gryn and Sheelah continued to push the cauldron forward. Sheelah told the wolves they could talk outside.
		* The skeletal frost giant made an appearance. It tried to freeze Ragnar but he resisted.
		* Midnight persuaded the wolves to help against the giant.
	* Round 2
		* RJ cast _shield of faith_ on himself and launched _guiding bolt_ at the giant. It took some damage but kept charging.
		* Corem leaped over the cauldron and growled at the giant while Keiran encouraged the party to get out.
		* Gryn changed to some other farm and attacked the giant.
		* Sheelah continued push the cauldron and took a pot shot at the giant.
		* Ragnar held his position.
		* The giant advanced on Ragnar, who struck first with his sword. The giant swung at Ragnar and Corem with his axe. Ragnar managed to shield himself but Corem was struck.
		* Midnight struck the giant with an _eldritch blast_.
	* Round 3
		* RJ _turned_ the giant.
		* Corem breathed a cone of cold on the giant.
		* Gryn got the cauldron out of the cave.
		* Sheelah fired at the giant and damaged it.
		* Ragnar hit the giant with _booming blade_
		* The giant began to leave and took thunder damage from the _booming blade_. Ragnar and Corem both attacked as it fled. Ragnar brought it down.
	* Corem took a bone for gnawing and trophy. The group managed to get the cauldron out.
	* When the group left the cave, a **lady** was waiting, wearing an owlbear mask and holding a long staff. After being asked by Midnight, she said she was a servant of the Frostmaiden.
	* Midnight and Gryn said the killings were self defense and justice.
	* RJ ran up to the lady and suddenly felt **very cold**.
	* The conversation got a little weird after that. She was very clear that the group was **not** welcome in the area. Midnight and the lady had a conversation.
	* The group discussed the threat and the elven tomb.
	* The group brought the cauldron back and something? The note taker disappeared for a short time.
	* On their way to the speaker's place, the group passed out a lot of food from the cauldron to the citizens. This got the attention of the town captain.
	* Midnight offered to exchange the cauldron for wealth and information. The captain went to get the Speaker. The party took the cauldron inside. Sheelah, RJ, and Ragnar stayed with the cauldron. Midnight and Gryn went to talk to the Speaker.
	* The Speaker's office had a lot of nice stuff but it looks well used.
	* The Speaker offered **5 gemstones** for Easthaven to have the Cauldron of Plenty.
		* He didn't know anything about the woman or the elven tomb.
		* He didn't know anything about the shardalin except that it has magical properties and they have some in the basement.
		* The gems were actually **illusions** and the group would be paid in 48 hours.
		* Midnight and Gryn seemed to believe him. Midnight asked for collateral.
	* The group decided to watch the cauldron until the Speaker can get the gems. They continued to pass out food to the town. The people in the town became _very_ interested in the cart and the cauldron.
		* Midnight continued researching the spellbook she had been given.
		* RJ stayed with the kobolds to guard the cauldron.
		* Ragnar went around looking for blacksmiths and such.
		* Sheelah went looking for studded leather and information on the strange place to the south. She found it is "dark" and there is "a lot of crazy shit". It looks like a Duergar stronghold surrounded by yeti. A Duergar fortification has been built near Kelvin's Caern. Less scary than the Spine place. No one knows much about Caer-Dineval.
		* Ragnar and Midnight worked together on his magic.
		* Prudence, who works for Nareth, asked the party if they were willing to sell the cauldron. They declined and Prudence left. The party made **haste** to get back to the cart and protect the cauldron. Prudence and a bunch of tough assholes with flying snakes made a showing.
		* Round 1
			* Gryn used _starry form: archer_ and struck one of the thugs and then cast _entangle_ in order to restrain some of the thugs.
			* Sheelah hit Prudence with an arrow, along with a _hail of thorns_
			* One of the thugs hit Sheelah with a crossbow bolt.
			* The kobolds kinda hung out.
			* Ragnar attacked one of them, who parried his attack.
			* RJ missed an attack and put up his _shield of faith_.
			* The polar bears became agitated and started shaking the cart.
			* Trex tried to calm them.
			* Prudence cast _firebolt_ at Ragnar but missed.
			* Midnight hit one of the thugs with _ice knife_, which also caused a small explosion of cold in the area.
		* Round 2
			* Gryn cast _guiding bolt_ at Prudence but missed. He also missed with his _archer form_.

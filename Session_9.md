		* Midnight persuaded the wolves to help against the giant.
	* Round 2
		* RJ cast _shield of faith_ on himself and launched _guiding bolt_ at the giant. It took some damage but kept charging.

		* Gryn changed to some other farm and attacked the giant.
		* Sheelah continued push the cauldron and took a pot shot at the giant.

	* Round 3
		* RJ _turned_ the giant.
		* Corem breathed a cone of cold on the giant.
		* Gryn got the cauldron out of the cave.
		* Sheelah fired at the giant and damaged it.
		* Ragnar hit the giant with _booming blade_
		* The giant began to leave and took thunder damage from the _booming blade_. Ragnar and Corem both attacked as it fled. Ragnar brought it down.
	* Corem took a bone for gnawing and trophy. The group managed to get the cauldron out.
	* When the group left the cave, a **lady** was waiting, wearing an owlbear mask and holding a long staff. After being asked by Midnight, she said she was a servant of the Frostmaiden.
	* Midnight and Gryn said the killings were self defense and justice.
	* RJ ran up to the lady and suddenly felt **very cold**.
	* The conversation got a little weird after that. She was very clear that the group was **not** welcome in the area. Midnight and the lady had a conversation.

## Session
* Immediately inside of the tomb were three statues of hooded elves carrying staves.
* Midnight determined that the Moondial has different messages depending on the phase of the moon. She attempted to mimic the light of the moon using _prestidigitation_ but it didn't have any effect.
	* Based on the calendar, the group determined it would take about 12 days before a useful phase came up.
* Ragnar investigated a sarcophagus that was nearby. Near it were five pillars with engravings:
	* Twig
	* Pine cone
	* Flame
	* Feather
	* Humanoid hand
* After that, the group looked at a nearby gazebo with a brazier in the center.
* Outside, Sheelah found a "door-shaped marble slab" that fit perfectly into the walls. Sheelah opened it from the inside.
* Inside, Ragnar examined some things
	* A door marked with a half moon, with the rounded edge on the right.
	* An oval mirror (7ft x 3.5ft) with a symbol of a full moon over it.
	* A door marked with a half moon, with the rounded edge on the left.
* With nothing to do, the group returned to their cart. At the cart, the group found the bears munching on goblins after the kobolds fended them off.

## Session
* Immediately inside of the tomb were three statues of hooded elves carrying staves.
* Midnight determined that the Moondial has different messages depending on the phase of the moon. She attempted to mimic the light of the moon using _prestidigitation_ but it didn't have any effect.
	* Based on the calendar, the group determined it would take about 12 days before a useful phase came up.
* Ragnar investigated a sarcophagus that was nearby. Near it were five pillars with engravings:
	* Twig
	* Pine cone
	* Flame
	* Feather
	* Humanoid hand
* After that, the group looked at a nearby gazebo with a brazier in the center.
* Outside, Sheelah found a "door-shaped marble slab" that fit perfectly into the walls.

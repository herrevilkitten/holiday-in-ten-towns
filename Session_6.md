# Session 6
## People and Places
## Session
* Immediately inside of the tomb were three statues of hooded elves carrying staves.
* Midnight determined that the Moondial has different messages depending on the phase of the moon. She attempted to mimic the light of the moon using _prestidigitation_ but it didn't have any effect.
	* Based on the calendar, the group determined it would take about 12 days before a useful phase came up.
* Ragnar investigated a sarcophagus that was nearby. Near it were five pillars with engravings:
	* Twig
	* Pine cone
	* Flame
	* Feather
	* Humanoid hand
* After that, the group looked at a nearby gazebo with a brazier in the center.
* Outside, Sheelah found a "door-shaped marble slab" that fit perfectly into the walls. Sheelah opened it from the inside.
* Inside, Ragnar examined some things
	* A door marked with a half moon, with the rounded edge on the right.
	* An oval mirror (7ft x 3.5ft) with a symbol of a full moon over it.
	* A door marked with a half moon, with the rounded edge on the left.
* With nothing to do, the group returned to their cart. At the cart, the group found the bears munching on goblins after the kobolds fended them off.
* RJ suggested that Trex research the _knock_ spell.
* The group returned to Lonelywood and brought the moose head to Nimsy and retrieved their reward of gold and cookies. She also invited the group to spend the night.
	* RJ tried to spread the word of Sheila.
* The group moved to the **The Happy Scrimshander** to talk with someone that Ragnar knows, **Iriskree Harrowhall**. He asked her for advice on how to get into the tomb.
	* She didn't have any _knock_ spells but she recommended that we visit **Speaker Dannith Wayland** in **Easthaven**. She said that if he can provide help, _she will consider his debt repaid_.
	* Ragnar asked her about the _weirdness_ that has been happening, like ice coming out of his fingers and that summoning stone. She informed Ragnar that he had received some kind of boon.
	* She gifted the party with some scrimshaw that was not selling well.
* The group returned to **Bryn Shander**.
	* They went to the **House of the Morning Lord** in order to talk about Jerod's burial and the requirements for it.
		* Midnight let the cleric know that one of the tasks had been completed and requested that Jerod have a proper burial before "we journey to the land of demons" (**Caer-Dineval**)
		* The priest informed the party that Jerod had family in Lonelywood and they need to be told about this death.
	* After some discussion, the group decided on continuing on to **Easthaven** to talk to the Speaker, return to **Bryn Shander** for Jerod's body, and then go onward to **Lonelywood**. For now, the group spent the night at the inn.
	* Hook: In **Easthaven**, they captured a wizard and plan to burn him at the stake. The captain of the guard is looking for adventurers for a related task.
	* The group went shopping at **Blackiron Blades**.
* The group went on to **Easthaven**.
	* The town has an inn called the **Wet Trout** and a place called the **White Lady**. People seem nice and positive.
	* A lot of people have gathered around a post in the middle of town, to which a man was tied.
		* Midnight notices the man tied to the pyre is her old school friend, Dezan. She looked around for any of his associates. She investigated and learned that he is being punished for killing several residents of the town.
		* The Captain of the Guard said that his guilt was beyond doubt but she would be interested in talking about his associates later.
		* Dezan got all lit up.
		* Midnight got as close to Dezan as she could and yelled out, "What did you do?"
		* He told Midnight to retrieve his spellbook from "them".
		* The people of this town have _issues_.
		* The Captain asked the group to meet her in the town hall.
	* The group went to the town hall.
		* The Captain asked what brought the group to the town. Ragnar mentioned that they were here to see the Speaker. Unfortunately, he is "busy".
		* Some townsfolk are missing and she would like some help with recovering them. In return, she would put in a good word for us.

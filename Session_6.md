# Session 6
## People and Places
## Session
* Immediately inside of the tomb were three statues of hooded elves carrying staves.
* Midnight determined that the Moondial has different messages depending on the phase of the moon. She attempted to mimic the light of the moon using _prestidigitation_ but it didn't have any effect.
	* Based on the calendar, the group determined it would take about 12 days before a useful phase came up.
* Ragnar investigated a sarcophagus that was nearby. Near it were five pillars with engravings:
	* Twig
	* Pine cone
	* Flame
	* Feather
	* Humanoid hand
* After that, the group looked at a nearby gazebo with a brazier in the center.
* Outside, Sheelah found a "door-shaped marble slab" that fit perfectly into the walls. Sheelah opened it from the inside.
* Inside, Ragnar examined some things
	* A door marked with a half moon, with the rounded edge on the right.
	* An oval mirror (7ft x 3.5ft) with a symbol of a full moon over it.
	* A door marked with a half moon, with the rounded edge on the left.
* With nothing to do, the group returned to their cart. At the cart, the group found the bears munching on goblins after the kobolds fended them off.
* RJ suggested that Trex research the _knock_ spell.
* The group returned to Lonelywood and brought the moose head to Nimsy and retrieved their reward of gold and cookies. She also invited the group to spend the night.
	* RJ tried to spread the word of Sheila.
* The group moved to the **The Happy Scrimshander** to talk with someone that Ragnar knows, **Iriskree Harrowhall**. He asked her for advice on how to get into the tomb.
	* She didn't have any _knock_ spells but she recommended that we visit **Speaker Dannith Wayland** in **Easthaven**. She said that if he can provide help, _she will consider his debt repaid_.
	* Ragnar asked her about the _weirdness_ that has been happening, like ice coming out of his fingers and that summoning stone. She informed Ragnar that he had received some kind of boon.
	* She gifted the party with some scrimshaw that was not selling well.
* The group returned to **Bryn Shander**.
	* They went to the **House of the Morning Lord** in order to talk about Jerod's burial and the requirements for it.
		* Midnight let the cleric know that one of the tasks had been completed and requested that Jerod have a proper burial before "we journey to the land of demons" (**Caer-Dineval**)
		* The priest informed the party that Jerod had family in Lonelywood and they need to be told about this death.
	* After some discussion, the group decided on continuing on to **Easthaven** to talk to the Speaker, return to **Bryn Shander** for Jerod's body, and then go onward to **Lonelywood**.
	* Rumors: In **Easthaven**, they captured a wizard and plan to burn him at the stake. The captain of the guard is looking for adventurers for a related task.

# Session 1
## New People, Places, Things

## Session

* The group got two rooms for the night and went to sleep.
* RJ and Ragnar were woken by loud noise from outside. Looking out of a window, they saw the wizards of the Arcane Brotherhood. Dezan and Avarice  were in a shouting match about Dezan wanting to "go out there."  Avarice struck Dezan with some spell and walked away. Dezan got back to his feet and stumbled off in a different direction. The remaining wizards followed after Avarice.
* The rest of the night was quiet.
* The group woke up to the smell of cooking food (editor's note: it's not bacon if it's from a fish.) and went down for breakfast. It was free.
* Midnight indicated that Dezan and Avarice should be killed.
* RJ asked if anyone had any contacts in the north.
* Ragnar said that he had some contacts among the mercenary groups in Icewind Dale and was familiar with the people of the Blackiron Blades.
* Jerod talked about his hypothesis that the murderer has a sense of justice and doesn't think people should be able to buy their way out of their fate. He also mentioned the murderer may be someone who travels, like Torga.
* Midnight suggested this was a worshiper of the Frostmaiden, who sees it less as justice and more as giving the Frostmaiden what is hers.
* [Runa Oakenshield], along with his friends [Quartz] and [Stone], overheard the conversation and made a proposition to the party. Her group was tasked with delivering a sled with iron ingots to Bryn Shander, but they were ambushed by yeti and only barely made it back alive. She asked the group if they could recover the iron.
	* Ragnar said that we should take the job, but concentrate on the lottery. If the group happened to be in the area, then investigate the iron. There was some discussion on how long it would take to get to the area and back and the group decided it _would_ be possible to make it back before the lottery.
	* Midnight said it would be useful to build up some reputation before we investigate something like the murders, and it's always helpful to have friends.
	* RJ reminded us that we would earn the friendship of the dwarves.
	* Runa said that we should bring dogs or axebeaks if we want to try and bring the iron back.
* Despite everything, the group decided to help Runa and headed for Kelvin's Caern.
* While taking shelter during a blizzard, RJ noticed a smell of blood and went off to investigate. The rest of the group accompanied him.
	* A frozen, decapitated, dismembered corpse was found in an alcove, along two grooves in the snow, which looked a lot like sled tracks. The group decided that this was [Ubok], who had been violently killed earlier.
	* Because the blizzard was quickly covering up the tracks, the group immediately began following the them.
	* The group was able follow the thieves, who turned out to be some goblins with a wagon being pulled by _angry polar bears_.

### Combat
* Round 1
	* Midnight shot a shower of sparks as a distraction.
	* The polar bears did nothing.
	* RJ cast _bless_ on the party.
	* Jerod advanced towards where he thought the goblins were.
	* Ragnar advanced towards the goblins.
	* The "boss goblin" commanded the goblins to protect himself.
	* The rest of the goblins took formation around him and fired arrows at Jerod and Ragnar. Jerod was struck by two arrows.
* Round 2
	* Midnight fired a _ray of frost_ at one of the goblins and killed it.
	* The polar bears began to take notice of what is going on.
	* RJ struck one of the goblins with a crossbow.
	* Jerod advanced a bit and spent the rest of the round dodging attacks.
	* Ragnar advanced as well and stood in front of Jerod, and screamed at them and frightened them.
	* Despite being terrified of him, the goblins attacked Ragnar and managed to strike him twice.
* Round 3
	* Midnight cast _ray of frost_ again, striking an injured goblin and killing it.
	* The polar bears were _very_ interested in the combat.
	* RJ fired a _guiding bolt_ at the goblin boss. The boss anticipated this and pulled another goblin in front of him. That goblin was **exploded** by the bolt.
	* Jerod advanced and struck one of the goblins twice with his fists, killing it.
	* Ragnar attacked a goblin and only barely missed it. He then got a _second wind_.
	* The goblin boss attacked Ragnar, but missed.
	* The remaining two goblins also attacked Ragnar and missed.
* Round 4
	* Midnight once again struck a goblin with _ray of frost_.
	* The polar bears continued to chillax.
	* RJ fired a bolt at a goblin and missed.
	* Jerod punched one of the goblins and killed it. He then stepped forward to stand beside Ragnar.
	* Ragnar struck the remaining goblin with his sword, killing it.
	* The goblin boss disengaged from combat, freed the polar bears from their harness, and then continued running.
* Round 5
	* Midnight cast _eldritch blast_, but critically failed.
	* One of the polar bears, who was injured by the goblin boss, wounded him.
	* RJ fired a bolt at the goblin boss, wounding him more.
	* Jerod backed up and shouted to the group to "let the bears have the bodies!"
	* Ragnar _pulled a javelin out of his leg and threw it at the goblin boss_. WTF
* Round 6
	* Midnight attempted to cast a spell but couldn't quite get it out.
### End Combat
* RJ sidled up to the polar bear that was eating the goblin boss. He made friends with the bear and managed to retame it. The rest of the group just kind of stared.
* Midnight used the _command_ spell to control the other bear and have it "stay"
* RJ approached the commanded bear and befriended it in the same way that he befriended the first; he then managed to get both hooked up to the wagon
* Some dwarves came out to see what is going on and noticed that we were _not_ goblins and were pretty impressed.
	* They were very happy that we recovered the ingots and invited us to stay and rest for the night before taking the ingots to Bryn Shander in the morning.
* In the morning, the group returned to Runa and settled up, before taking the ingots to Blackiron Blades.
	* For all of this, the party was rewarded with **4 gems (50gp)** and given a **10% discount on everything at Blackiron Blades**.
* The party arrived back in town just after the lottery had been drawn and noticed a number of sad faces. It did not appear the Bryn Shander sacrifice had the money to pay off anyone.

## Session

* The group got two rooms for the night and went to sleep.
* RJ and Ragnar were woken by loud noise from outside. Looking out of a window, they saw the wizards of the Arcane Brotherhood. Dezan and Avarice  were in a shouting match about Dezan wanting to "go out there."  Avarice struck Dezan with some spell and walked away. Dezan got back to his feet and stumbled off in a different direction. The remaining wizards followed after Avarice.
* The rest of the night was quiet.
* The group woke up to the smell of cooking food (editor's note: it's not bacon if it's from a fish.) and went down for breakfast. It was free.
* Midnight indicated that Dezan and Avarice should be killed.
* RJ asked if anyone had any contacts in the north.
* Ragnar said that he had some contacts among the mercenary groups in Icewind Dale and was familiar with the people of the Blackiron Blades.
* Jerod talked about his hypothesis that the murderer has a sense of justice and doesn't think people should be able to buy their way out of their fate. He also mentioned the murderer may be someone who travels, like Torga.
* Midnight suggested this was a worshiper of the Frostmaiden, who sees it less as justice and more as giving the Frostmaiden what is hers.
* [Runa Oakenshield], along with his friends [Quartz] and [Stone], overheard the conversation and made a proposition to the party. Her group was tasked with delivering a sled with iron ingots to Bryn Shander, but they were ambushed by yeti and only barely made it back alive. She asked the group if they could recover the iron.

## Session

* The group got two rooms for the night and went to sleep.
* RJ and Ragnar were woken by loud noise from outside. Looking out of a window, they saw the wizards of the Arcane Brotherhood. Dezan and Avarice  were in a shouting match about Dezan wanting to "go out there."  Avarice struck Dezan with some spell and walked away. Dezan got back to his feet and stumbled off in a different direction. The remaining wizards followed after Avarice.

### Day 5
* The remaining group decided on what to do with Jerod's body. They eventually chose to bring him back to Brin Shander and turn it over to the temple there.
* After the return to Brin Shander, they stopped at Blackiron Blades to do some shopping for health potions and kits.
* Afterwards, they went to the House of the Morning Lord to deposit Jerod's body. They arrived just as service was ending.
	* _Stuff happened while the note taker was doing other stuff_
* The party is thinking about doing something about a moose in the Lonely Wood.
* _Some OOC discussion about the locations and quests in Icewind Dale happened_
* The group decided to stop in [Termalaine] on the way to Lonely Wood. There is a situation regarding kobolds in a mine there.
* Before leaving, the group looked for [Lin Trollsbane] in the Northlook to collect their reward. Lin was out back, talking to a [dwarven woman with red hair].
* Lin introduced [Sheelah] to the group. She was standoffish to everyone but Ragnar (being that he's from the North) but agreed to work with them on some quests for the House.
* The party continued on to [Termalaine]. The Speaker is Oris Maskhew. Neither Sheelah nor Ragnar knew much about him. Because the mines were infested, there's a lot of people not doing anything.
* Ragnar suggested staying at the Eastside Inn, where things would be a little more relaxed. The Blue Clam is probably filled with miners who are angry.
* The Eastside Inn is run by Marta Peskrit. Her father, Clyde, is a retired fisherman. A pair of men hushed up and left when the party came in. Marta was singing a song about _a dead woman_ (an old family song?)
* The party asked for some food and rooms and took some seats.
* It was fish. Complaining was done.
* Midnight asked Marta about a ring she wore on a necklace. It was payment rendered to Marta's grandparents, from a woman dressed in red that stayed at the inn 50 years ago. The woman disappeared under _very_ strange circumstances involving battering winds infesting the inn. Jenna determined there is something special about it, but not what. She also asked Marta if there are any troubles happening in Termalaine.
	* She talked about the kobolds infesting the minds. She also said that not long before the kobolds came to town, a "smart fella" showed up in town. He went out to the gem mine and never came back.
	* Speaker Maskhew is offering 50 gold to anyone who can solve the problem with the mine.
* Jenna roomed with Sheelah for the night.
* The group visited the Speaker. He didn't have a lot to say, except that there's a reward for whomever figures out what is wrong with the mines.
	* Jenna asked the Speaker about the mysterious man who visited the mines. He didn't have a lot to say.
	* Ragnar decided that Oris was withholding information. He warned the group to be careful.
* The group headed to the mines. On a sign outside, written in common with charcoal, was "Kobolds Only"

### Day 5
* The remaining group decided on what to do with Jerod's body. They eventually chose to bring him back to Brin Shander and turn it over to the temple there.
* After the return to Brin Shander, they stopped at Blackiron Blades to do some shopping for health potions and kits.
* Afterwards, they went to the House of the Morning Lord to deposit Jerod's body. They arrived just as service was ending.
	* _Stuff happened while the note taker was doing other stuff_
* The party is thinking about doing something about a moose in the Lonely Wood.

### Day 5
* The remaining group decided on what to do with Jerod's body. They eventually chose to bring him back to Brin Shander and turn it over to the temple there.
* After the return to Brin Shander, they stopped at Blackiron Blades to do some shopping for health potions and kits.

* Before leaving, the group looked for [Lin Trollsbane] in the Northlook to collect their reward. Lin was out back, talking to a [dwarven woman with red hair].
* Lin introduced [Sheelah] to the group. She was standoffish to everyone but Ragnar (being that he's from the North) but agreed to work with them on some quests for the House.
* The party continued on to [Termalaine]. The Speaker is Oris Maskhew. Neither Sheelah nor Ragnar knew much about him. Because the mines were infested, there's a lot of people not doing anything.

## Session
* Torga is taking the party through the mountain pass. She warns them about the [Ice Maiden](Characters.md#Auril)
* The party camps for the night.
* RJ and Jenna notice the shape of a human figure, wearing fur or feathers above their shoulders and carrying a staff.
* There is a low rumble and an avalanche fell from above and towards the group. Although everyone was hit by the snow and ice, [Torga], [Stefic], Jenna, and Ragnar took the worst of it.
* Everyone began digging themselves out as well as they could. Jenna made it first, followed by RJ and Ragnar.
* Stefic and half of the dwarves were missing.
* Jerod lost his rope.
* The group began looking around for the dwarves and dogs. Ragnar found some of the missing packages and the sled. RJ and Jerod discovered frost-bitten dwarves. Jenna dug out several of the dogs. Stefic, one of the dwarves, and one of the dog sleds was lost forever. Torga blamed the Ice Maiden for this.
* After camping for the night, the group continued following the trail towards [Bryn Shander].
* Despite it being day time, it was very dark outside.
* RJ asked about the darkness and Torga responded
	* Every new moon, the Ice Maiden casts a spell that covers Icewind Dale in darkness. This has been going on for several years.
* Jenna ventured off to find books and research material about the Ice Maiden's Darkness. She was directed towards the townhall.
* Jerod headed off to the temple of the [Morninglord](Characters.md#Lathander).
* RJ just went around and ended up at Blackiron Blades. He questioned the clerk about the Auril situation.
* Jerod talked with the priestess of [Amaunator](Characters.md#Amaunator) about the current situation. She suggested that Jerod go to the "Northlook"
* Jenna spent her time asking around the townhall about the Ice Maiden. This attracted attention from someone who did not approve of "random people asking questions about scrolls and the ice maiden." She was asked to leave.
* Rangar went to the Northlook in order to find work. He has some reputation already and most people have an opinion. He got "the usual" but made it a double.
* Jerod ordered heated mead.
* Jenna charmingly asked Scramshacks for help in getting information about Auril. He did not respond in the most positive way, but he did direct her to some wizards from [Luskan](Places.md#Luskan).
* RJ was warned not be outside after "dark dark." There have been some murders.
* After booking rooms, Scramshacks mentioned Old Bitey and Jerod asked for more information. After Jerod tried touch it, it began to sing.
* Jenna sat silently in  corner and spied on the people nearby, who were talking about the [murders](Hooks.md#The_Murders).

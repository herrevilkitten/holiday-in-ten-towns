# Session 18
Party preparation time!
* The party moved south from the Ten Towns, towards Dougan's Hole and the mountains to the south.
* Sheelah guided the group through the icy mountains, foraging and hunting along the way.
* The party arrived at the fortress in the peaks of the Spine of the World.
* The party came to a high, hewn wall with arrow-slits carved everywhere. A series of steps carved into the wall led to a frosty shelf.

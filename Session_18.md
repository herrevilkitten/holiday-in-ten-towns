# Session 18
Party preparation time!
* The party moved south from the Ten Towns, towards Dougan's Hole and the mountains to the south.
* Sheelah guided the group through the icy mountains, foraging and hunting along the way.
* The party arrived at the fortress in the peaks of the Spine of the World.
* The party came to a high wall with arrow-slits carved everywhere. A series of steps carved into the wall led to a frosty shelf and the front of the fortress.
* The party pulled a GIANT BADGER out of the bag of tricks and used their skills to get to the top.
* The badger got the attention of one of the duergar guards.
* ROUND 1
	* BADGER BITE TO THE FACE.
	* GRYN FIRE TO THE FACE.
	* BADGER CLAWS TO THE FACE.
	* Sheelah sends two arrows into the duergar's butt and it dies.
	* Ragnar ran up to the duergar in the Doorway and smacked it twice and killed it.
	* The remaining duergar super-sized itself.
	* Midnight blasted a duergar.
	* Gryn starry archers the last one and it got a _really_ bad sunburn.
* Gryn carefully examined one of the duergar and took its war pick.
* Inside of the fortress, a single duergar stood watch on the left.
* Sheelah closed the portcullis and the group moved to an intersection  to the east.
* They continued east.
* East.
* The north room said Duerth's Quarters. The east room says Nildar's Quarters.
* Went north.
* Bed, trunk, unlit braziers. Oh wait, I meant mimic, not trunk.
* Ragnar is **stuck to the mimic**.
* Ragnar manages to escape from the mimic
* ROUND 1
	* Midnight blasts the mimic. Twice.
	* Gryn managed to almost archer form himself.
	* Ragnar goes snickity snick.
	* Sheelah pierces it to hell and something next door got REALLY interested.
	* RJ took cover and blessed Ragnar, Gryn, Sheelah, and Midnight.
	* A _giant ogre zombie_ showed up and smacked the hell out of Midnight. Midnight helps it chill out.
* ROUND 2
	* Midnight vampire touched the ogre zombie and looked a little better.
	* Gryn starry archered it.
	* Two javelins missed Sheelah.
	* Ragnar moved into the doorway of the room and yelled very quietly at Duerth's brother before attacking the zombie ogre.
	* Sheelah sends the zombie back to DEATH.
	* RJ just hung out and waited.
* ROUND 3
	* Badger tracked down the (probably invisible) duergar
	* Midnight followed the badger but did not see anything. She cast _false life_ on herself.
	* Gryn moved next to the door.
	* A duergar woman appeared, flanked by three enlarged duergar. She said, "Nildar, stay your hand. It appears we have guests." Midnight lied. Badly. The duergar didn't seem very impressed and she asked the Midnight, Gryn, and the badger to accompany her back to her room. The others remained hidden.
* They had a pleasant conversation. She did a lot of talking about why she is in the fortress and the future of Ten Towns.
* Gryn, Midnight, and the duergar came to an _understanding_ that would be mutually beneficial to both. Gryn gave them some _bracers of defense_ in order to secure the pact. In return, she provided information.
* Gryn studied her. This will be entertaining.
* The party rested. Nildar was handled in an amotionall

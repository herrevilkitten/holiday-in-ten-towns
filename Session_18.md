# Session 18
Party preparation time!
* The party moved south from the Ten Towns, towards Dougan's Hole and the mountains to the south.
* Sheelah guided the group through the icy mountains, foraging and hunting along the way.
* The party arrived at the fortress in the peaks of the Spine of the World.
* The party came to a high wall with arrow-slits carved everywhere. A series of steps carved into the wall led to a frosty shelf and the front of the fortress.
* The party pulled a GIANT BADGER out of the bag of tricks and used their skills to get to the top.
* The badger got the attention of one of the duergar guards.
* ROUND 1
	* BADGER BITE TO THE FACE.
	* GRYN FIRE TO THE FACE.
	* BADGER CLAWS TO THE FACE.
	* Sheelah sends two arrows into the duergar's butt and it dies.
	* Ragnar ran up to the duergar in the Doorway and smacked it twice and killed it.
	* The remaining duergar super-sized itself.
	* Midnight blasted a duergar.
	* Gryn starry archers the last one and it got a _really_ bad sunburn.
* Gryn carefully examined one of the duergar and took its war pick.
* Inside of the fortress, a single duergar stood watch on the left.
* Sheelah closed the portcullis and the group moved to an intersection  to the east.
* They continued east.
* East.
* The north room said Duerth's Quarters. The east room says Nildar's Quarters.
* Went north.
* Bed, trunk, unlit braziers. Oh wait, I meant mimic, not trunk.

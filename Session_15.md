# Session 15

* The group worked their way south through a blizzard. Sheelah noticed something was coming but could not make out what. She let everyone know. The ceramorphs did not seem too bothered by everything.
	* "We do not believe it wants to be our friend."
* The group prepared for the encounter by hiding and fortifying the cart.
* It was a mounted rider with pale blue skin wearing a helmet adorned with horns. Riding a mammoth.
* Ragnar javelin'd him
* ROUND 1
	* Sheelah managed to get through the blizzard with an arrow and strike it in the shoulder.
	* The Rider lowered a lance-like thing and began charging the cat.
	* Gryn _guiding bolted_ the Rider and followed it up with his archer form.
	* Trex hit the Rider with a crossbow.
	* Midnight _blasted_ the Rider.
	* The Rider rode into the traps that Gryn set up earlier and threw his javelin at the cart. The impact sent Ragnar crashing to the ground.
	* RJ missed with a _guiding bolt_
	* The bears growled and snarled.
	* Ragnar failed at throwing.
* ROUND 2
	* Kobolds manage to strike the Rider.
	* Sheelah arrow'd the hell out of him.
	* Gryn missed with his guiding bolt but his archer form ruined his day.
	* Trex missed.
	* Midnight did a little bit of damage.
	* Leap attack at Gryn with a massive axe! And Gryn goes down.
	* RJ calls for the lightning! RIP Giant.
* RJ kept Gryn from dying.
* Sheelah cast _speak with animals_ and tried to convince the mammoth to go home.
* ROUND ???

# Session 15

* The group worked their way south through a blizzard. Sheelah noticed something was coming but could not make out what. She let everyone know. The ceramorphs did not seem too bothered by everything.
	* "We do not believe it wants to be our friend."
* The group prepared for the encounter by hiding and fortifying the cart.

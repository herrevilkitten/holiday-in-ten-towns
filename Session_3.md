## Session
### Day 4
* The group warmed up in the Luskan Arms in the night after the execution. Guards and mercenaries made their way in and out.
* Midnight took some time to ask her Patron about [Sethic] aka Weird Ice Guy.
	* She received a vision of a man (most likely [Sethic]) in the snow being approached by a giant wolf and having some kind of interaction with him.
* Ragnar went out to check the inn for a way to get into the Speaker's room. They didn't seem a way to get up to the window and the area was patrolled regularly. Captain Skarth noticed and decided to talk to him.
* RJ just chilled.
* Jerod had some dinner and just listened for anything interesting going on. The guards are talking about how Naerth keeps escaping Auril's wrath and how the murders are happening. He noticed a hatch for a laundry or coal chute near the bar.
* Ragnar and Skath came to an understanding.
* Ragnar went to visit the polar bears and feed them. He somehow did not lose any body parts.
* Ragnar returned to the inn and chatted with Jerod. Jerod pointed out the laundry/coal chute. It wouldn't fit someone the size of Ragnar but a smaller person could squeeze through.
* The group set up a watch in the inn. Ragnar went first. He heard a suspicious sound. He investigated and saw that two guards were arguing with each other. Ragnar approached to provide aid and one of them insulted him and told to get back in the inn. The other guard, who had been knocked to the ground, was helped by Ragnar and expressed thanks.
* Ragnar woke up RJ for the next shift.
* RJ took a place by a window and watched. He noticed that one of the stable doors had come unlatched and was slamming against the wall of the barn. He noticed and then watched a humanoid walking down the street. While trying to watch, he draws attention to himself and the figure turns out to be Captain Skath.
* RJ woke up Jerod for the next shift.
* Jerod looked around for things to place on top of the chute hatch but didn't find a lot to hold it down. He stacked a few bottles on top of the hatch and then stayed in the downstairs area of the inn. He didn't notice anything. He fell asleep and was jerked awake by a scream.
* He ran to wake Midnight and then ran outside to investigate.
* When Jerod ran out, he saw guards and wolves fighting.
* Midnight woke up the others and ran outside.
* RJ followed after.
* The bottles on the hatch crashed down.
### COMBAT
* Round 1
	* RJ tripped getting out of bed and was unable to make it outside -- but he was around to hear the bottles break.
	* Ragnar had trouble getting his armor on, but made it down.
	* Midnight cast an _eldritch blast_ at one of the wolves.
	* Jerod facepunched one of the wolves and killed it. He advanced more and facepunched the second wolf, twice, and also killed it. Then a giant wolf appeared.
* Round 2
	* Ragnar finished with his armor and went downstairs.
	* RJ noticed wolves coming out of the chute. He attacked the wolves and managed to injure one.
	* One of the wolves attacked RJ and inured him. RJ's divine lightning blew him the hell up.
	* Another wolf attacked one of the guards and knocked him down while biting him.
	* Midnight tried to strike a wolf with her _eldritch blast_ but missed. She advanced and noticed the dire wolf nearby.
	* Ragnar threw a javelin at one of the wolves inside of the inn.
	* Jerod landed another punch on the wolf next to him, but failed to fell out. He heard clanging noises coming from inside and shouted to the remaining guard to go inside.
	* The dire wolf bit Jerod seriously.
* Round 3
	* RJ heard someone shout "It's coming through the window"
	* The small wolf attacked Jerod, but missed.
	* Midnight cast _eldritch blast_ at the large wolf and then retreated.
	* Ragnar did something but I missed it.
	* The small wolf bit Jerod and took him down.
	* Jerod failed his death save.
	* SOMEBODY went after Naerth in his room.
	* The dire wolf attacked Midnight, but missed.
* Round 4
	* RJ ran up the stairs and cast _shield of faith_.
	* The wolves howled.
	* Ragnar ran into the room. He saw [Sethic Caltro] attacking [Naerth]. He grabbed the *orc stone* to summon an orc warrior chief named [Vakar] between Sethic and Naerth.
	* The orc warrior attacked Sethic and let out a war cry (this round, everyone who attacks Sethic has advantage). His first strike missed but his second hit.
	* Captain Skath ran in and missed Sethic with his crossbow.
	* Jerod failed his death save.
	* Sethic complained about the will of Auril and stuff and struck at the warchief.
	* A wolf broke into the inn and began mauling one of the guards.
	* Naerth is feeling more confident and attacked Sethic with a short sword, poorly.
* Round 5
	* RJ attacked the wolf that was mauling the guard.
	* The wolf attacked RJ but missed.
	* Midnight attempted to stabilize Jerod. The dire wolf did not attack Midnight.
	* Ragnar struck Sethic.
	* Orc warrior hit Sethic twice. (advantage wears off now)
	* Wolf attacks a guard.
	* Captain Skath misses, then hits, Sethic.
	* Jerod succeeded at his death save.
	* Sethic strikes Ragnar and then runs for the window to jump out of it. That was a poor decision. Ragnar struck him down.
	* A wolf jumped up to the second floor.
	* Naerth thanked everyone for saving his life.
* Round 6
	* RJ fired at a wolf with his crossbow and killed it.
	* Midnight called for a medic and tried to move Jerod someplace with less blood.
	*

## Session
### Day 4
* The group warmed up in the Luskan Arms in the night after the execution. Guards and mercenaries made their way in and out.
* Midnight took some time to ask her Patron about [Sethic] aka Weird Ice Guy.
	* She received a vision of a man (most likely [Sethic]) in the snow being approached by a giant wolf and having some kind of interaction with him.
* Ragnar went out to check the inn for a way to get into the Speaker's room. They didn't seem a way to get up to the window and the area was patrolled regularly. Captain Skarth noticed and decided to talk to him.
* RJ just chilled.
* Jerod had some dinner and just listened for anything interesting going on. The guards are talking about how Naerth keeps escaping Auril's wrath and how the murders are happening. He noticed a hatch for a laundry or coal chute near the bar.
* Ragnar and Skath came to an understanding.
* Ragnar went to visit the polar bears and feed them. He somehow did not lose any body parts.
* Ragnar returned to the inn and chatted with Jerod. Jerod pointed out the laundry/coal chute. It wouldn't fit someone the size of Ragnar but a smaller person could squeeze through.
* The group set up a watch in the inn. Ragnar went first. He heard a suspicious sound. He investigated and saw that two guards were arguing with each other. Ragnar approached to provide aid and one of them insulted him and told to get back in the inn. The other guard, who had been knocked to the ground, was helped by Ragnar and expressed thanks.
* Ragnar woke up RJ for the next shift.
* RJ took a place by a window and watched. He noticed that one of the stable doors had come unlatched and was slamming against the wall of the barn. He noticed and then watched a humanoid walking down the street. While trying to watch, he draws attention to himself and the figure turns out to be Captain Skath.
* RJ woke up Jerod for the next shift.
* Jerod looked around for things to place on top of the chute hatch but didn't find a lot to hold it down. He stacked a few bottles on top of the hatch and then stayed in the downstairs area of the inn. He didn't notice anything. He fell asleep and was jerked awake by a scream.
* He ran to wake Midnight and then ran outside to investigate.
* When Jerod ran out, he saw guards and wolves fighting.
* Midnight woke up the others and ran outside.
* RJ followed after.
* The bottles on the hatch crashed down.
### COMBAT
* Round 1
	* RJ tripped getting out of bed and was unable to make it outside -- but he was around to hear the bottles break.
	* Ragnar had trouble getting his armor on, but made it down.
	* Midnight cast an _eldritch blast_ at one of the wolves.
	* Jerod facepunched one of the wolves and killed it. He advanced more and facepunched the second wolf, twice, and also killed it. Then a giant wolf appeared.
* Round 2
	* Ragnar finished with his armor and went downstairs.
	* RJ noticed wolves coming out of the chute.

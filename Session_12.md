## Session
* The party spent money on things.	
* Avarice sent a missed to Gryn, instructing the party to meet her in Caer Koenig for the trip to the Spire.
* ***Travel Montage***
* During the journey to Caer-Koenig, RJ noticed that an item in his pack -- a tribal dreamcatcher -- was glowing. He showed everyone else!
	* Weird stuff happened but Sheelah's headset died so /shrug
* The group arrived at Caer-Koenig. It's a nice place. The group went to the Northern Lights to meet Avarice. The innkeepers don't seem to be thrilled about her staying.
	* Avarice's familiar flew down and landed on Gryn's head and pecked at it.
	* Midnight overplayed her hand trying to get Avarice's cloak as a reward.
	* Ragnar made sure that Avarice was paying her bills
* On the road with Avarice
	* The party was dive bombed by two stony creatures. They landed, flanking Avarice.
	* Avarice and RJ had a discussion on religion and boyfriends
	* Sheelah and Avarice chatted quite a bit as they went along, since Sheelah was guiding the group through the wastes.
		* There's an ANCIENT WHITE DRAGON
		* Avarice and Midnight have a mutual appreciation of each other.
		* Sheelah has studied the ancient dwarven art of not giving a shit.
	* The party camped. Gryn spoke sweet nothings to the polar bears and worked on setting up a sweet campfire.
		* RJ's band was blinking even more.
		* STUFF HAPPENED THAT SHEELAH MISSED
		* Watch order
			* Midnight
				* Midnight spent the entire time brooding over Avarice and not watching.
				* Eventually she started watching. It was really, _really_ quiet.
			* Sheelah
				* Sheelah noticed that Avarice was _wide awake_
				* Sheelah was the most perceptive dwarf _ever_ and nothing snuck up on her
			* Ragnar
				* Uneventful just like the others.
		* Next morning, Avarice did not eat with the rest of the group and "got the rest she required"
		* Sheelah continued leading the group and keeping Avarice from killing everyone
		* The group arrived at the Spire.
			* Sheelah checked it out. It was _weird_ and did not make sense in Icewind Dale.
			* Avarice walked around looking for the entrance. She had trouble remembering or knowing where it was...
			* Sheelah and Ragnar kept watch.
			* Midnight helped Avarice look for the entrance _out of spite_
			* Avarice found the entrance and gathered everyone together
			* The entrance was a tunnel coming out at a sharp angle. It did not look safe.
			* Ragnar went down fir

## Session
* The party spent money on things.	
* Avarice sent a missed to Grin, instructing the party to meet her in Caer Koenig for the trip to the Spire.
* ***Travel Montage***
* During the journey to Caer-Koenig, RJ noticed that an item in his pack -- a tribal dreamcatcher -- was glowing. He showed everyone else!
	* Weird stuff happened but Sheelah's headset died so /shrug
* The group arrived at Caer-Koenig. It's a nice place. The group went to the Northern Lights to meet Avarice. The innkeepers don't seem to be thrilled about her staying.
	* Avarice's familiar flew down and landed on Grim's head and pecked at it.

## People and Places
## Session
* Sheelah gave _goodberries_ to get everyone back up.
* RJ cast _prayer of healing_ to top people off.
* The group decided on what to do with the bodies, especially Prudence.
	* The bodies were taken to the Speaker. He agreed that it was Prudence and that she was working with the Zentarim.
	* The guard captain asked if the group was keeping the deal with the town and if the group could stay until the gems are acquired.
	* Ragnar failed to persuade her to add extra payment but she said they are definitely "friends"
* Downtime!
	* Gryn purchased a lot of oil for his shop and went looking for books on lock making. He didn't find any, but he did get a pointer to Lonely Wood. He also picked up some studded leather armor.
	* RJ let Beatrice know the fate of her fisherman husband.
	* Ragnar and Midnight helped Sheelah learn how to be more perceptive. With punches to the face.
	* Midnight started researching a new spell, but couldn't quite get the hang of it yet.
	* Ragnar worked on his ðŸª„ magic ðŸª„
* The group returned to the speaker and received the gems for the cauldron.
* The group decided to visit Caer-Dinival. Sheelah helped make the trip a bit easier.
* The group arrived at the Caer.
	* The inn, Dinev's Rest, looked boarded up. Gryn reminded us that at the seance, we were warned that the Duergar were occupying "Dinev's Rest".
	* They headed for the tavern, The Uphill Climb.
		* _Stuff Happened While Sheelah's Player Was Out_
	* According to rumors, sketchy stuff is happening at the castle.
	* The tavern keeper is Rourke
	* The group decided to use the knowledge of the Duergar as a ruse to get into the castle.
	* The castle guards were dressed in black and wearing amulets made out of _shards of shardalin_. Midnight inquired about the amulet and was rebuffed, gently. The group managed to bluff themselves in and made small talk with one of the guards while the other went to get someone in charge.
		* Apparently they worship "the Frozen Prince"
	* The newcomer talked about how the speaker is sick and asked why the group is here.
	* The group mentioned there is a threat and how they help speakers with problems.
	* In order to see the speaker, the group would need to put their weapons aside. Gryn determined that they were being _mostly_ forthcoming.
	* The party discarded their weapons (except for Midnight, who managed to fool them about her spellbook) and went into the courtyard.
	* Inside of the grand hall, things were run down, with broken lights. A tiefling, Mir, servant was collecting the dishes. The group went through a door to the left into a "well-appointed sitting room". Cadroth was in an adjacent room.
	* Ragnar insisted that the group speak to the Speaker. Thoob got some additional guards and escorted the group to the Speaker's room.
	* An attendant for the Speaker indicated that he was too sick and could not speak to anyone.
	* Midnight offered to help the Speaker with her medical skills. Unfortunately, she could not persuade them. Neither could Gryn.
	* Ragnar's foot was much more persuasive.
	* The presumed Speaker was squatting on a chamber pot. As the group busted in, he said "_Perfect timing_," his voice dripping with sarcasm.
	* Round 1
		* RJ cast _bless_
		* Midnight cast _hold person_ on Brick
		* Yajath drew a scimitar.
		* Ragnar threatened Yajath and he backed down.
	* The Speaker congratulated the group and asked what they intended to do now.
	* One of the "knights" explained that the Frost Prince had ordered them to secure the castle and protect the town from the Duergar.
	* Also, the group are apparently assholes.
	* Yajath gave his backstory. About how all of these people almost died out on the ice but were saved by the ~~Black~~ Frost Prince, who said a war is coming and his rival wants to take over Ten Towns.
	* Cardath showed up. Things got weird but not violent. We learned the Knights of the Black Sword worship Levistus, one of the lords of the Hells. He's also frozen in a block of ice.
	* Avarice is hanging out at the castle as well.
	* The group received some pamphlets about Levistus.
	* The party went to the Duergar inn and kicked in the door. Again.
	* Ragnar yelled that he know the little bastards were there. The Duergar taunted from him from hiding. Midnight responded with a taunt of her own.
	* A javelin went flying at Ragnar.
	* Round 1
		* RJ casts _guiding bolt_ on the Duergar and it went down smoking.
		* Sheelah taunted the remaining Duergar.
		* Two MASSIVE appaeared Duergar swung at Ragnar. One of them hit.

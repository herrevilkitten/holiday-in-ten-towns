## Session
_The group is at the White Lady Inn_
* The kobolds, led by [Trex], asked the group for some money for supplies for themselves and the bears. They were given **20 gold pieces** and went off to purchase the supplies.
* Our new friend, [Gryn], wanted to meet the bears, so [RJ] took him over to feed the them.
* The group went down to the (frozen) lakeside to investigate the ferry. Gryn and RJ noticed that the door had been damaged somewhat. The ferry had a sign reading "Out of Service" and the name of the owner of the boat, [Cython]
* The door was definitely broken in.
* Gryn, [Midnight], and [Ragnar] decided to investigate the boat. RJ and [Sheelah] stayed on the dock.
	* There are footprints inside of the ship. Humanoid feed, but much larger.
	* There's an unpleasant smell.
	* Crates have been broken into, spilling rations and food everywhere.
	* Midnight listened at a door that had some light spilling out from under it. She didn't hear anything and decided to open the door.
	* Gryn continued going through the boxes.
	* Ragnar stood guard.
	* Outside, a fisherman approached RJ and Sheelah, who were not acting suspicious _at all_. They managed to convince him that they were looking for Cython and he kindly gave them directions.
	* Inside, Midnight found no one in the room, but did find some sleeping bags and a table with a number of items on it.
		* A map of Icewind Dale with the settlements and Kelvin's Caern marked off, along with a place in the mountain.s
		* Dried rations
	* Gryn and Midnight continued searching. They heard some light breathing that suddenly stopped. Gryn called out "Hello" and then poked in the direction of the breathing with his staff. Breathing person took a swing at Gryn. _Everyone heard this._ The person's invisibility faded and he appeared to be a white-skinned dwarven
	* ROUND 1
		* Sheelah ran downstairs.
		* Ragnar ran upstairs, gave the dwarf a warning, and then javelined him as an extra special warning.
		* RJ ran along with Sheelah and cast _shield of faith_
		* The dwarf ([Dearth Sunblight]) crazily threatened everyone and tried to _charm_(?) Midnight. He then ran away and took a _lot_ of hits from people.
		* Gryn followed the crazy dwarf upstairs.
		* Midnight followed the crazy dwarf upstairs and cast _hold person_ on him. He got stuck there for a while.
	* ROUND 2
		* Sheelah ran from the bottom to the top (which is the deck of the boat).

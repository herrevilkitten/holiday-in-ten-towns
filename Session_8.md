## Session
_The group is at the White Lady Inn_
* The kobolds, led by [Trex], asked the group for some money for supplies for themselves and the bears. They were given **20 gold pieces** and went off to purchase the supplies.
* Our new friend, [Gryn], wanted to meet the bears, so [RJ] took him over to feed the them.
* The group went down to the (frozen) lakeside to investigate the ferry. Gryn and RJ noticed that the door had been damaged somewhat. The ferry had a sign reading "Out of Service" and the name of the owner of the boat, [Cython]
* The door was definitely broken in.
* Gryn, [Midnight], and [Ragnar] decided to investigate the boat. RJ and [Sheelah] stayed on the dock.
	* There are footprints inside of the ship. Humanoid feed, but much larger.
	* There's an unpleasant smell.
	* Crates have been broken into, spilling rations and food everywhere.
	* Midnight listened at a door that had some light spilling out from under it. She didn't hear anything and decided to open the door.
	* Gryn continued going through the boxes.
	* Ragnar stood guard.
	* Outside, a fisherman approached RJ and Sheelah, who were not acting suspicious _at all_. They managed to convince him that they were looking for Cython and he kindly gave them directions.
	* Inside, Midnight found no one in the room, but did find some sleeping bags and a table with a number of items on it.
		* A map of Icewind Dale with the settlements and Kelvin's Caern marked off, along with a place in the mountain.s
		* Dried rations
	* Gryn and Midnight continued searching. They heard some light breathing that suddenly stopped. Gryn called out "Hello" and then poked in the direction of the breathing with his staff. Breathing person took a swing at Gryn. _Everyone heard this._ The person's invisibility faded and he appeared to be a white-skinned dwarven
	* ROUND 1
		* Sheelah ran downstairs.
		* Ragnar ran upstairs, gave the dwarf a warning, and then javelined him as an extra special warning.
		* RJ ran along with Sheelah and cast _shield of faith_
		* The dwarf ([Dearth Sunblight]) crazily threatened everyone and tried to _charm_(?) Midnight. He then ran away and took a _lot_ of hits from people.
		* Gryn followed the crazy dwarf upstairs.
		* Midnight followed the crazy dwarf upstairs and cast _hold person_ on him. He got stuck there for a while.
	* ROUND 2
		* Sheelah ran from the bottom (the hold) to the top (the deck), which is where she was at the beginning of round 1.
		* Ragnar continued to ruin Dearth's day, critically so.
		* RJ ran to the bottom of the stairs, fired his crossbow, and pierces the hell out of him. He dwarf returned to normal size and his daggers returned to normal.
		* Gryn decided to keep watch while Midnight looted the body. She found a "translucent rock" that looked interesting. She didn't know what it was. Neither did Gryn.
		* Sheelah explained the _Duergar_ to the others. They're bad folk and don't show up on the surface.
	* After some discussion, the group decided to take the body to the authorities and explain what happened.
		* When they arrived, Ragnar explained what happened. Midnight showed the rock. The captain identified the rock as _shardalin_, a special kind of rock.  She also mentioned a few things about the marks on the map, namely that the dwarves would know more about Kelvin's Caern and the other (in the south) is in the middle of nowhere.
		* The group was asked about what happened at the Cauldron. Lies may have been said.
		* The captain told the party about [Renaldo], a halfling that runs seances at the White Lady Inn.
	* The captain escorted the group to the inn. Renaldo started to put on one hell of a show.
		* The group found seats and drinks.
		* Renaldo called for the _White Lady_ to make herself known. Frost covered the windows and the candles went out.
		* Midnight, Gryn, and Sheelah decided to help with the seance.
		* Gryn asked, "Dear Lady of the Lake, what danger is heading to Ten Towns?"
			* He saw Easthaven in flames and heard a voice: _there are gray-skinned dwarves that hide here and they, they stay in Denneth's Rest_
		* Midnight asked, "What is the the Frost Maiden's plan for Ten Towns."
			* She heard a voice: _the Maiden only wants to rule winter and for everyone to know her pain, the cold pain of winter_
		* Sheelah asked, "White Lady, what's so special about this shardalin we found?"
			* Sheelah saw visions of an _upside-down city_ somewhere in the mountains and saw that parts of the city have objects made of shardalin, and heard: _far in the mountains, darkness rests; a dark power_
		* The waitress brought more drinks.
		* Ragnar told the captain about his vision.
		* Sheelah explained about the upside-down city and shardalin.
		* The captain left and the group decided on some down time.
	* Gryn stayed at his home. Midnight went through D'zan's spellbook.
		* Gryn slept poorly, he kept thinking about the vision of flames but realized that there was a _massive dragon made of shardalin_ above the town.
		* Sheelah slept like babby

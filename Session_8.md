## Session
_The group is at the White Lady Inn_
* The kobolds, led by [Trex], asked the group for some money for supplies for themselves and the bears. They were given **20 gold pieces** and went off to purchase the supplies.
* Our new friend, [Gryn], wanted to meet the bears, so [RJ] took him over to feed the them.
* The group went down to the (frozen) lakeside to investigate the ferry. Gryn and RJ noticed that the door had been damaged somewhat. The ferry had a sign reading "Out of Service" and the name of the owner of the boat, [Cython]
* The door was definitely broken in.
* Gryn, [Midnight], and [Ragnar] decided to investigate the boat. RJ and [Sheelah] stayed on the dock.
	* There are footprints inside of the ship. Humanoid feed, but much larger.
	* There's an unpleasant smell.
	* Crates have been broken into, spilling rations and food everywhere.
	* Midnight listened at a door that had some light spilling out from under it. She didn't hear anything and decided to open the door.
	* Gryn continued going through the boxes.
	* Ragnar stood guard.
	* Outside, a fisherman approached RJ and Sheelah, who were not acting suspicious _at all_. They managed to convince him that they were looking for Cython and he kindly gave them directions.
	* Inside, Midnight found no one in the room, but did find some sleeping bags and a table with a number of items on it.
		* A map of Icewind Dale with the settlements and Kelvin's Caern marked off, along with a place in the mountain.s
		* Dried rations

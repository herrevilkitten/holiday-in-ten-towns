# Session 14

* It's time to play the Identification Game
	* Ragnar punched Midnight and she learned her cloak provides some kind of protection.
	* Grin has some bracers, a shardalin scroll tube, and a key
		* The scroll tube contains a scroll of _dispel magic_
* There's an unexplored room. Let's fix that.
	* A bedroom of some sort. Bed, tatters, mirror, skeleton. Oh, looks like the old wizard has become the will o the wisp.
	* Midnight pushed passed Ragnar and looked around.
	* RJ _mended_ the mirror.
	* Ragnar picked up the bed to look under/over it. Underneath the bed is a treasure chest.
	* Grin's key unlocked the chest. Inside the _climate controlled chest_ was a spell book. On the book was a symbol that matched Midnight's amulet.
	* She took the book and it... crumbled into dust.
* On the way back up, the group ran into a bugbear corpse with a hole burned through its chest. Above, at the entrance to the spire, the group overheard fighting.
* ROUND 1
	* RJ protected himself with a magical shield and tried to sneak up and see what is going on.
	* Sheelah (and everyone) climbed up as well.
	* A bunch of bugbears were attacking The Cart, which was being defended by strange little halfling mindflayers and ice worms. Sheelah was way too weirded out by this to do anything.
	* Bugbears attacked Ragnar and Grin. Grin got really messed up. I mean, really.
	* Midnight moved a little and got two of them with _frost fingers_.

	* RJ blasted the chief with a whole lot of stuff.
	* Sheelah killed the bugbear that was engaged with Grin and tried to strike the Chief.
	* Some of the bugbears fired crossbows at the bears and hit one.
	* A Coldlight Walker:tm: made itself known and it _exploded the eyes of one of the bugbears_ omfg and then it fired a ray of cold energy at the bugbear (but missed, twice)

	* Midnight struck one of the bugbears with her _eldritch blast_ and took him out.
	* The ceromorphs killed another of the bugbears.
	* The kobolds scratched one of the bugbears.
	* Ragnar politely asked the Chief to team up against the newcomer. The Chief diplomatically declined. Then Ragnar killed the blinded one and injured the Chief.

	* The carrion crawler gtfo

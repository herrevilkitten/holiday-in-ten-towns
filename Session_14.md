# Session 14

* It's time to play the Identification Game
	* Ragnar punched Midnight and she learned her cloak provides some kind of protection.
	* Grin has some bracers, a shardalin scroll tube, and a key
		* The scroll tube contains a scroll of _dispel magic_
* There's an unexplored room. Let's fix that.
	* A bedroom of some sort. Bed, tatters, mirror, skeleton. Oh, looks like the old wizard has become the will o the wisp.
	* Midnight pushed passed Ragnar and looked around.
	* RJ _mended_ the mirror.
	* Ragnar picked up the bed to look under/over it. Underneath the bed is a treasure chest.
	* Grin's key unlocked the chest. Inside the _climate controlled chest_ was a spell book. On the book was a symbol that matched Midnight's amulet.
	* She took the book and it... crumbled into dust.
* On the way back up, the group ran into a bugbear corpse.

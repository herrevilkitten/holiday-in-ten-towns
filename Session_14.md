# Session 14

* It's time to play the Identification Game
	* Ragnar punched Midnight and she learned her cloak provides some kind of protection.
	* Grin has some bracers, a shardalin scroll tube, and a key
		* The scroll tube contains a scroll of _dispel magic_
* There's an unexplored room. Let's fix that.
	* A bedroom of some sort. Bed, tatters, mirror, skeleton. Oh, looks like the old wizard has become the will o the wisp.
	* Midnight pushed passed Ragnar and looked around.
	* RJ _mended_ the mirror.
	* Ragnar picked up the bed to look under/over it. Underneath the bed is a treasure chest.
	* Grin's key unlocked the chest. Inside the _climate controlled chest_ was a spell book. On the book was a symbol that matched Midnight's amulet.
	* She took the book and it... crumbled into dust.
* On the way back up, the group ran into a bugbear corpse with a hole burned through its chest. Above, at the entrance to the spire, the group overheard fighting.
* ROUND 1
	* RJ protected himself with a magical shield and tried to sneak up and see what is going on.
	* Sheelah (and everyone) climbed up as well.
	* A bunch of bugbears were attacking The Cart, which was being defended by strange little halfling mindflayers and ice worms. Sheelah was way too weirded out by this to do anything.
	* Bugbears attacked Ragnar and Grin. Grin got really messed up. I mean, really.
	* Midnight moved a little and got two of them with _frost fingers_.
	* The Bears chilled.
	* The "ceromorphs" struck one of the bugbears with its ray gun.
	* Ragnar missed his attacks on a bugbear.
	* The carrion crawler struck one of the bugbears.
	* Grin fucked up the bugbear that was attacking him with a _guiding bolt_
	* Some bugbears engaged the carrion crawler
	* The chief attacked Ragnar, but missed
* ROUND 2
	* RJ blasted the chief with a whole lot of stuff.
	* Sheelah killed the bugbear that was engaged with Grin and tried to strike the Chief.
	* Some of the bugbears fired crossbows at the bears and hit one.
	* A Coldlight Walker:tm: made itself known and it _exploded the eyes of one of the bugbears_ omfg and then it fired a ray of cold energy at the bugbear (but missed, twice)
	* The bears messed up some bugbears.
	* Midnight struck one of the bugbears with her _eldritch blast_ and took him out.
	* The ceromorphs killed another of the bugbears.
	* The kobolds scratched one of the bugbears.
	* Ragnar politely asked the Chief to team up against the newcomer. The Chief diplomatically declined. Then Ragnar killed the blinded one and injured the Chief.
	* Grin noticed another coldlight walker when it showed up.
	* Stuff happened, like the bugbears killing a carrion crawler.
	* Grin did an ice knife at some bug bears and changed to a starry dragon form.
	* Chief strikes Ragnar
* ROUND 3
	* RJ crossbowed the Chief and moved closer to Gryn
	* Sheelah struck the Chief with her shortsword once.
	* SNOWBALL GOES DOWN.
	* Ragnar is NOT blinded by the Walker
	* Jeff almost avenges Snowball
	* Midnight actually does avenge Snowball
	* More pew-pew laser shots.
	* Kobolds inconvenience a bugbear.
	* Ragnar crits the Chief after failing to convince him about the advantages of an alliance.
	* A walker exploded the eyes of another bugbear.
	* Another dead bugbear.
	* Gryn took to the skies and launched a guiding bolt at one of the walkers, but missed.
* ROUND 4
	* RJ ran up and _healing worded_ the bears. He also realized he knows the carrion crawlers.
	* Sheelah hit one of the walkers with an arrow, but there's no indication if it was damaged.
	* The blind bugbear gets smushed and frozen.
	* The bears seem really happy to see everyone.
	* Jenna missd

# Session 21
## Now is the time on Sprockets when we go sledding.
* AND WE'RE OFF
	* And it's already going bad. Sheelah damages the sled with poor steering.
	* Then the winter wolves showed up
		* One of them decided to help with the steering.
		* Sheelah told them to fuck the hell off and drove steady.
		* Gryn was not bitten by the other.
	*

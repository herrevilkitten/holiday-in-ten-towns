# Session 19 - Duergar Love
* Pseudodragon led the group to a hole that led down into the mountain. The sounds of a forge rumbled up. A portcullis blocked the path to the hole.
* Then the pseudodragon flew down the hole.
* RJ was able to squeeze through the bars of the portcullis. He then lost all sense of reason and _jumped and grabbed a chain hanging in the middle of the hole_. He swung and grabbed a lever that raised the portcullis up.
* The elevator made its way up. Inside of the cab were four duergar and a strange, insectoid creature.
* ROUND HELD ACTION
	* RJ fired a bolt into the elevator but missed.
	* Midnight tried to blast the creature, but missed. After looking at the creature, she became confused.
	* Gryn ignited one of the duergar.
* ROUND ONE
	* The umber hulk munched on one of the duergar and clawed him the hell up.
	* One of the duergar tried to restrain the umber hulk.
	* RJ cast _spirit guardians_ on himself.
	* Sheelah missed, twice. Even with _hail of thorns_.
	* Midnight was just chilling.
	* Gryn missed with another _produce flame_ and asked if the group should just go down and let the umber hulk go crazy.
	* Burned Duergar grows in size and hits Gryn with a javelin.
	* Ragnar got an eyeful of the umber hulk and just started staring at the floor.
	* One of the duergar grabs the umber hulk's arm.
* ROUND TWO
	* The umber hulk takes his arm back and bites the hell out of him.
	* The third duergar got larger and threw a javelin at Ragnar.
	* RJ guided the light on one of the duergar.
	* Sheelah took down two of the duergar with her arrows and hail of thorns and did a little bit of damage to the umber hulk.
	* The badger messed up the duergar's balls.
	* Midnight blasted the duergar to death. She then forced the hell out of the umber hulk.
	* Gryn got confuzzled and went on walkabout.
	* Ragnar closed his eyes and went swinging, hitting once.
* ROUND THREE
	* Hulk mad! And tried to go crazy on Ragnar but he was all shielded up.
	* RJ moved a bit and then was unable to bolt the hulk.
	* Sheelah is just bad at archery and should retire. She then moved out of LOS.
	* The badger got confused and just started lashing out.
	* Midnight's willpower resisted the the eyes of the umber hulk. s

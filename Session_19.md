# Session 19 - Duergar Love
* Pseudodragon led the group to a hole that led down into the mountain. The sounds of a forge rumbled up. A portcullis blocked the path to the hole.
* Then the pseudodragon flew down the hole.
* RJ was able to squeeze through the bars of the portcullis. He then lost all sense of reason and _jumped and grabbed a chain hanging in the middle of the hole_. He swung and grabbed a lever that raised the portcullis up.
* The elevator made its way up. Inside of the cab were four duergar and a strange, insectoid creature.
* ROUND HELD ACTION
	* RJ fired a bolt into the elevator but missed.
	* Midnight tried to blast the creature, but missed. After looking at the creature, she became confused.
	* Gryn ignited one of the duergar.
* ROUND ONE
	* The umber hulk munched on one of the duergar and clawed him the hell up.
	*

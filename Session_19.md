# Session 19 - Duergar Love
* Pseudodragon led the group to a hole that led down into the mountain. The sounds of a forge rumbled up. A portcullis blocked the path to the hole.
* Then the pseudodragon flew down the hole.
* RJ was able to squeeze through the bars of the portcullis. He then lost all sense of reason and _jumped and grabbed a chain hanging in the middle of the hole_.

# Session 19 - Duergar Love
* Pseudodragon led the group to a hole that led down into the mountain. The sounds of a forge rumbled up. A portcullis blocked the path to the hole.
* Then the pseudodragon flew down the hole.
* RJ was able to squeeze through the bars of the portcullis. He then lost all sense of reason and _jumped and grabbed a chain hanging in the middle of the hole_. He swung and grabbed a lever that raised the portcullis up.
* The elevator made its way up. Inside of the cab were four duergar and a strange, insectoid creature.
* ROUND HELD ACTION
	* RJ fired a bolt into the elevator but missed.
	* Midnight tried to blast the creature, but missed. After looking at the creature, she became confused.
	* Gryn ignited one of the duergar.
* ROUND ONE
	* The umber hulk munched on one of the duergar and clawed him the hell up.
	* One of the duergar tried to restrain the umber hulk.
	* RJ cast _spirit guardians_ on himself.
	* Sheelah missed, twice. Even with _hail of thorns_.
	* Midnight was just chilling.
	* Gryn missed with another _produce flame_ and asked if the group should just go down and let the umber hulk go crazy.
	* Burned Duergar grows in size and hits Gryn with a javelin.
	* Ragnar got an eyeful of the umber hulk and just started staring at the floor.
	* One of the duergar grabs the umber hulk's arm.

	* Sheelah took down two of the duergar with her arrows and hail of thorns and did a little bit of damage to the umber hulk.
	* The badger messed up the duergar's balls.
	* Midnight blasted the duergar to death. She then forced the hell out of the umber hulk.
	* Gryn got confuzzled and went on walkabout.
	* Ragnar closed his eyes and went swinging, hitting once.
* ROUND THREE
	* Hulk mad! And tried to go crazy on Ragnar but he was all shielded up.
	* RJ moved a bit and then was unable to bolt the hulk.
	* Sheelah is just bad at archery and should retire. She then moved out of LOS.
	* The badger got confused and just started lashing out.
	* Midnight's willpower resisted the the eyes of the umber hulk. She moved closer and cast _poison spray_ on it. That just made it angry.
	* Gryn cast a misguided _guiding light_. He *blipped* out and reappeared 30 feet up in the air, learning that it's not the fall that hurts, but the sudden stop.
	* Ragnar kept his eyes closed and tried _really_ hard to hit the umber hulk, hitting one time out of four, instantly making him better than most of the Mets.
* ROUND FOUR
	* The umber hulk was weaksauce against Ragnar with a wee little scratch.
	* RJ's guardians scratched  the umber hulk in return. He missed with his crossbow.
	* Sheelah continued to be bad.
	* The badger claw-bite demonstrated it is more useful in this fight than Sheelah.

	* Ragnar hits the umber hulk once.

	* RJ held his action.
	* Sheelah went after the hulk but then just stared after it longingly :heart:
	* Badger fucked up the umber hulk. Crazy nastyass honey badger don't care.
	* Midnight blew the umber hulk up with a blast. Crazy nastyass honey badger danced in the carnage.
* The group loaded all of the bodies on the elevator and descended in the elevator. Subtle.
* The party reached the bottom. Gryn was disguised as Grindalfa.
* A duergar came out **speaking undercommon** and talked to Gryn-dalfa. Gryn tried to convince him that there's a new policy. Gryn went all "I want to talk to your manager" on him.
* The duergar asked the group what they're doing here. Midnight responded with something about following the pseudodragon.

* Oh and the king was about to let the dragon free.
* Ragnar and Gryn used their Jedi mind tricks to get all of the plans. The plans were not that unexpected.

* Party: _murders_
* SURPRISE

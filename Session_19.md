# Session 19 - Duergar Love
* Pseudodragon led the group to a hole that led down into the mountain. The sounds of a forge rumbled up. A portcullis blocked the path to the hole.
* Then the pseudodragon flew down the hole.
* RJ was able to squeeze through the bars of the portcullis. He then lost all sense of reason and _jumped and grabbed a chain hanging in the middle of the hole_. He swung and grabbed a lever that raised the portcullis up.
* The elevator made its way up. Inside of the cab were four duergar and a strange, insectoid creature.
* ROUND HELD ACTION
	* RJ fired a bolt into the elevator but missed.
	* Midnight tried to blast the creature, but missed. After looking at the creature, she became confused.
	* Gryn ignited one of the duergar.
* ROUND ONE
	* The umber hulk munched on one of the duergar and clawed him the hell up.
	* One of the duergar tried to restrain the umber hulk.
	* RJ cast _spirit guardians_ on himself.
	* Sheelah missed, twice. Even with _hail of thorns_.
	* Midnight was just chilling.
	* Gryn missed with another _produce flame_ and asked if the group should just go down and let the umber hulk go crazy.
	* Burned Duergar grows in size and hits Gryn with a javelin.
	* Ragnar got an eyeful of the umber hulk and just started staring at the floor.
	* One of the duergar grabs the umber hulk's arm.

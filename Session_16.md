# Session 16

Black Cabin stuff.
Midnight and Gryn scouted ahead.
Midnight goes in first, because the cabin structure is sus.
A magical explosion happened some time in the past!
A strange gyroscopic device was on the table! Surrounded by the skeleton bits of a human priest.
Gryn found a squirrel nest and a laboratory.
Midnight decided to pick up the device.
The device decided to start glowing.

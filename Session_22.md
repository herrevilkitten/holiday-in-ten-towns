# Session 22
* The party sold the loot for 3465GP
* Some people are behaving _odd_ when injured
	* Becoming manic
	* Almost rabid
	* Seems to be people who came into contact with the dragon flame or the chardalyn shards
* The party discovered that the weapons makers were over at Kelvin's Caern and because the party wants weapons, they followed.
* The dwarves are _really_ concerned about "The Boys" because  "The Boys" are having the "ancient blue fire" "burn in their eyes" and they've blocked off the cave.
*

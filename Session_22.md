# Session 22
* The party sold the loot for 3465GP
* Some people are behaving _odd_ when injured
	* Becoming manic
	* Almost rabid
	* Seems to be people who came into contact with the dragon flame or the chardalyn shards
* The party discovered that the weapons makers were over at Kelvin's Caern and because the party wants weapons, they followed.
* The dwarves are _really_ concerned about "The Boys" because  "The Boys" are having the "ancient blue fire" "burn in their eyes" and they've blocked off the cave.
* In the cave...
	* The three (Midnight, RJ, Sheelah) went into the cave (of course). While going along the path to the cave, Sheelah thought she saw something move behind them. The mouth of the cave was carved into a bear's mouth.
	* There's some strange white-scaled creatures curled up in balls on the floor. Midnight decided to bother them. :|
	* Oh shit. White dragon wyrmlings!
	* It turns out that Midnight speaks Draconic. She tried to keep them calm.
	* Midnight threw them a fish.
	* It got worse.
	* Everyone decided to back up and let the wyrmlings do their own thing.
	* RJ investigated the cells. Midnight watched the wyrmlings. Sheelah watched RJ and the other tunnel.
	* The party's being followed. Everyone could feel it. Sheelah noticed _3_ of them flatten themselves against the wall. CHARGE
* ROUND 1
	* RJ cast _bless_ on everyone.
	* Sheelah _hailed of thorns_ and damaged two of the weird creatures. She REALLY missed the third and almost hit her self.
	* One of the creatures charged at her with a flail and threw a chardalyn javelin at her.
	* Midnight moved a bit and colded them hell out of them.
	* Badger hits! And misses!
	* Midnight gets hit and takes some damage but is not poisoned! More glacial rebuke!
* ROUND 2
	* RJ creates his sunflower! It waded into battle and he tried to crossbow from afar.
	* Sheelah hits one of them with a _single arrow_
	* That same one hits her with a single attack with a flail.
	* Midnight eldritch blasts. One of them hit and the other knocked her backwards.
	* Badger went crazy on a berserker.
	* Both berserkers went crazy on the badger and smashed it out of existence.
* ROUND 3
	* RJ _shattered_ them for a whole lot of damage.
	* Sunflower smacked one of them.
	* Sheelah messed one of them the hell up.
	* The same one charged Sheelah and hit her once.
	* Midnight _eldritch blasted_ Sheelah's opponent to hell. But still alive!
	* One of the berserkers basically ruined Sheelah's day. The other missed.
* ROUND 4
	* RJ _shattered_ for a little bit of damage but they both resisted it.
	*

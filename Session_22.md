# Session 22
* The party sold the loot for 3465GP
* Some people are behaving _odd_ when injured
	* Becoming manic
	* Almost rabid
	* Seems to be people who came into contact with the dragon flame or the chardalyn shards
* The party discovered that the weapons makers were over at Kelvin's Caern and because the party wants weapons, they followed.
* The dwarves are _really_ concerned about "The Boys" because  "The Boys" are having the "ancient blue fire" "burn in their eyes" and they've blocked off the cave.
* In the cave...
	* The three (Midnight, RJ, Sheelah) went into the cave (of course). While going along the path to the cave, Sheelah thought she saw something move behind them. The mouth of the cave was carved into a bear's mouth.

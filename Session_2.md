## Session
### Day 3 of Ten Towns
* It is the next day, after a night of strange dreams, the group eats a large breakfast of fish and biscuits. Everything is fish.
* Ragnar informed the group that he has a history with the [sheriff of Targos] and would need to be careful when he's there. Apparently he did not perform a dubious job that the sheriff had for him and he's been on thin ice since then.
* The party has decided to continue on to Targos because of the time left until the execution ([Day 4]).
* Midnight asked Ragnar about a mountain peak that was discussed in some correspondence she had received. Ragnar told her what he knew about the peak and how it's basically a death sentence to travel to it without a guide. He offered to provide names of guides for her.
* As the party left the inn, a teenager ran up to the group and told them that the polar bears the party had acquired were _hungry_ and causing _problems_. The group made their way to the stable to see that the stablehands were defending themselves with pitchforks and shields. [Sheriff Markham Southwell]A [dark-skinned man with a shaved head] asked the group if the bears belong to them.
* Midnight and RJ worked together to calm the bears. Midnight explained that the bears are hungry and need meat.
* The man sent others off to get fish while Midnight and RJ kept the bears calm. They calmed down a great deal after being fed. The group discussed how to handle the costs to feed the bears (1 gold per day per bear) for a while before Jerod tried to get the party back on track.
* The sheriff introduced himself and said we were welcome in his town as long as we can keep everything handled.
* Jerod informed the party that he wished to speak to the acolyte of the House of the Morninglord. As the group made their way into the House, they heard two voices (the priestess and [Copper Noggerknocker]) arguing over chores.
* Copper said that he has a friend ([McCreads]) in an "old cabin" a "little ways from here". This friend has some interesting ideas and may have a device-based solution for the endless winter. He located north of Lonely Wood, "up the river a little bit." He is apparently an eccentric inventor and Copper has not heard from his recently.
* The party then made their way to Targos. It went quickly.

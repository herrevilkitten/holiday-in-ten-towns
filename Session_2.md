## Dreams and Portents
* _Last night, Jerod has a dream, he is in the snowy wilderness you all just left, he sees a figure crouching over a mound of snow dressed in fur and feathers with a set of ram horns jutting from its forehead near a scraggly dead tree, the figure is piling snow on the mound harder and harder patting it down, Jerod can hear muffled screaming from under the snow. The figure quickly turns its head to look at Jerod, the face is that of an owl covered beak and eye in blood and flesh. Then Jerod is underneath the snow, he is yelling and trying desperately to crawl out, then a beam of brilliant sunlight flashes before his eyes and he wakes up._
